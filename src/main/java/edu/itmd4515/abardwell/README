Lab 5

a. The entity that I chose is an inventory management system for Dresses. I think the best way to go about this is to have
dress types, and names associated with each dress. Next, I think it will be important to include sizes for the dress, quantity of
dresses on hand, and maybe the cost of the dress. More to come on this as I think things through in the next few days.
Alternatively, I can create an employee database with basic information such as name, birthdate, position, employee type, salary.

For the sake of completing lab 5, I went through the class demonstration with just including dress types and name. In this example
name just refers to the name of the dress, or maybe even the "owner" of the dress. I'll have this better defined for next labs so that
I can limit the amount of rework needed on the final project. There are some things that will need to be updated, primarily around using DOB as it is not applicable.

b. An entity is defined as an object with an independent existence that can be differentiated from other objects.
It can be an object with a physical existence, such as a student or a car, or it can be an object with a conceptual existence,
such as a course, or a position. An entity is considered weak if its tables are existence dependent. Other entities could be
dress size, dress name, dress cost, dress fabric and dress color.
